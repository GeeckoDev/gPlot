gPlot++ 1.0 by Geecko, 2012

* INTRODUCTION *

gPlot++ is a function plotter for PSP made by Geecko, coded using C++.

Several libraries are used:
    - muParser, a math parser library (https://github.com/GeeckoDev/muParser)
    - gLib2D, a 2D graphics library made by Geecko (https://github.com/GeeckoDev/gLib2D)
    - intraFont, a font rendering library made by BenHur (https://github.com/GeeckoDev/intraFont-G)
    - Danzeff, an OSK library made by Danzel and Jeff Chen (https://github.com/GeeckoDev/Danzeff-G)
    
gPlot++ can plot up to 4 functions at the same time. These are computed asynchronously to let the view run at 60fps, allowing smooth zoom and pan through it.

Since gPlot++ makes uses of muParser to parse the expressions, some functions and operators are predefined such as sin(), exp(), sqrt(), +, ^, <, >, etc. The complete list is available at http://muparser.sourceforge.net/mup_features.html#idDef2.
